# Type-safe HTTP APIs

**An Introduction to Servant**


[Servant](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/) is a Haskell
library for type-safe HTTP APIs. At its core, it allows to create HTTP API
specifications at the type-level. On top of that it

- allows to implement a server for a given API specification,
- generically obtain client functions for accessing APIs in Haskell,
- generate code for client functions in other languages (javascript, elm, etc.),
- generate API documentation (e.g. swagger),
- and more.

This talk is a an introduction to using Servant for web-programming in Haskell.

*About the speaker*: [SÃ¶nke Hahn](https://github.com/soenkehahn) is a Haskell
developer and one of the authors and maintainers of Servant.
